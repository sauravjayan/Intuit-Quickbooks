# Intuit-Quickbooks

Intuit released version 3 of the QuickBooks software in 1995. This project focuses on using respose data obtained from wave 1 of their mailing campaign for this
product to model the responses for wave 2. 

The results from the model was then used to undertake a more targeted approach to mailing, thereby cutting down losses in this marketing campaign.
